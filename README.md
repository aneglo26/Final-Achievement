# Final-Achievement

This is the last achievement from the Data Analytics course at Career Foundry

A fictional car company is going to start buying a fleet of used cars in the USA based on the offers available in a period of a month on Craigslist!

You will find all the Excel files used from the first interation of the dataframe, to the last one cleaned to be used in SQL.
For this project the main tools used were Excel, SQL and Tableau.
